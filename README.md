## About_this_App
A Beautifully designed Online Bookstore which contains multiple Books, the site allows you to search your favourite book in the bookstore, i didnt added too many book in database for now, but you can customize the site the way you like with the help of the source code present in this repository. You can purchase any book you like by two payment methods the first option is of paypal and the other one is debit card, use the sandbox paypal account please :)

Also, before purchasing any book you will be redirected to the login or signup page. So that new users can signup on the site and then can buy their favourite book. The site also informs which book is available and which one is out of stock !.
